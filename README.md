# NoteSender

This Android application allows you to create a list of notes, store them in an SQLite database, and send them via sms or email to one of your contacts.

Some of the app's features:

* Views make use of Fragments and ViewHolders for better performance and ease of use.
* ViewPager allows you to swipe through the notes without the need to return to the list of notes.
* Use of SQLite for data persistence.
* Sending notes to one of your contacts using email or sms. In order to fill the spinner with possible email addresses, the app scans your contacts for those entries that have email value set (or those that consist of only that, in case of some gmail imports).
* Easy adding and deleting notes using app toolbar.

This app was created as a university project.
